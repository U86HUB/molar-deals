            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              DentalDeals was born out of frustration. Our founders, both dental professionals, were tired of the high markups and lack of transparency in dental supply pricing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              In 2023, we set out to create a platform that would level the playing field for dental professionals â€“ giving them access to wholesale pricing and exclusive deals typically reserved for large dental service organizations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Today, DentalDeals partners with over 140 brands to bring significant savings to thousands of dental professionals across the country.
